    "# Factors\n",
    "Factors are the data objects which are used to categorize the data and store it as levels. They can store both strings and integers. They are useful in the columns which have a limited number of unique values. Like \"Male, \"Female\" and True, False etc. They are useful in data analysis for statistical modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Factors\n",
    "Factors are created using the factor () function by taking a vector as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factors in Data Frame\n",
    "On creating any data frame with a column of text data, R treats the text column as categorical data and creates factors on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changing the Order of Levels\n",
    "The order of the levels in a factor can be changed by applying the factor function again with new order of the levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating Factor Levels\n",
    "We can generate factor levels by using the gl() function. It takes two integers as input which indicates how many levels and how many times each level.\n",

    "\"labels\" is a vector of labels for the resulting factor levels.\n"
