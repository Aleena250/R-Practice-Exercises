    "# Vectors\n",
    "Vectors are the most basic R data objects and there are six types of atomic vectors. They are logical, integer, double, complex, character and raw.\n",

    "## Creating Vectors\n",
    "### Single Element Vector\n",
    "Even when you write just one value in R, it becomes a vector of length 1 and belongs to one of the above vector types.\n",
    "### Multiple Elements Vector\n",
    "1.Using colon operator with numeric data \":\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Using sequence (Seq.) operator\n",
    "  seq(start, end, by = step)\n",
    "  \n",
    "3.Using the c() function\n",
    "   The non-character values are coerced to character type if one of the elements is a character.\n",
    "   c('apple','red',5,TRUE) #The logical and numeric values are converted to characters.\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Accessing Vector Elements\n",
    "Elements of a Vector are accessed using indexing. The [ ] brackets are used for indexing. Indexing starts with position 1. Giving a negative value in the index drops that element from result.TRUE, FALSE or 0 and 1 can also be used for indexing.\n",

    "## Vector Manipulation\n",

    "### Vector arithmetic\n",
    "Two vectors of same length can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided giving the result as a vector output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Element Recycling\n",
    "If we apply arithmetic operations to two vectors of unequal length, then the elements of the shorter vector are recycled to complete the operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Element Sorting\n",
    "Elements in a vector can be sorted using the sort() function."
